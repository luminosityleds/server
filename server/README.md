## Getting Started
Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js on your computer, let's try to display "Hello World" in a web browser.

The code tells the computer to write "Hello World!" if anyone (e.g. a web browser) tries to access your computer on port 8080.

## Command Line Interface
Node.js files must be initiated in the "Command Line Interface" program of your computer.

How to open the command line interface on your computer depends on the operating system. For Windows users, press the start button and look for "Windows Powershell", or simply write "powershell" in the search field.

Navigate to the folder that contains the file "helloWorld.js", the command line interface window should look something like this:

C:\Users\Your Name>_
Initiate the Node.js File
The file you have just created must be initiated by Node.js before any action can take place.

1. Make sure you are at the root of this directory
2. Start your command line interface, write `node helloWorld.js` and hit enter:

Now, your computer works as a server!

If anyone tries to access your computer on port 8080, they will get a "Hello World!" message in return!

Start your internet browser, and type in the address: http://localhost:8080

You can exit out of the script running by pressing `Ctrl + C`
